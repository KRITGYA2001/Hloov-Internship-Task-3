# Hloov-Internship-Task4 
I have made a Project named "Integration of temperature data into IFC viewer," for Construir Hackathon under my internship with @Hloov. I would like to thank my mentor, @jithin for believing in me and my teammate @amit mishra for his excellent efforts and my CEO Mr @suhail arfath for constantly motivating us to strive to be a better version of ourselves.

1) Using Wall-ID as a sensor --> Showing of Temperature Data.
2) Changing the color of Walls Based on Temperature.
